# horologium-siderius
Simple, short and sweet astronomical clock that shows the positions of the stars in the night sky. Inspired by Dominic Ford's version of the astrolabe. With almucantars and azimuths, currently missing north-south functionality and city-dependent settings as well as appropriate masking.
